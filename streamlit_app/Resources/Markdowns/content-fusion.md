1. **Retrieved Information and User Query**: The process begins with the retrieved information from the Vector Database and the initial user query. 

2. **Response Template**: This information is then pushed through a response template. A response template is like an instruction manual that the Language Model (LLM) will follow. It contains instructions on how exactly the LLM should reply, using only the information retrieved from the Vector Database.

3. **Response Generation**: The LLM then generates a response along with the sources from each piece of information used. This ensures that the response is not only informative but also properly attributed.

4. **Markdown Evaluation**: The LLM evaluates the Markdown-based rendering of the response. If it determines that the response needs to be further modified for proper rendering, it makes the necessary adjustments.

This process allows for efficient and accurate content fusion and response generation, ensuring that the user receives a comprehensive, well-structured, and properly attributed response to their query.

The flow diagram for this stage is shown below.
