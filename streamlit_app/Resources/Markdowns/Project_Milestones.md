| 2 | Going beyond Naive RAG. Towards building a RAG architecture with Testable Evaluation Metrics | This requires going beyond Naive RAG and target a journal | 🧑‍🏭 |
| 3 | Multi modal output using an __Agent__ as a Proof of concept | - Storing meta data information about table etc.<br>- Using Agents in Langchain to __build__ a latex report | 🌜 |
