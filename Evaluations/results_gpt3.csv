The gluon TMDs involve two gauge links, which represent the non-local nature of the parton distributions and the interactions between the partons.

The Sivers function, which describes the correlation between the transverse spin of a nucleon and the transverse momentum of its partons, is expected to have a different sign in SIDIS compared to its observation in a Drell-Yan process.
