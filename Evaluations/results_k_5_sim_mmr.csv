 What is the energy dependence of the total cross section for real Compton scattering at Q2=0? What is the energy dependence of the total cross section for very high Q2?,"Hello! Here are some key points about the energy dependence of the total cross section for real Compton scattering at Q2=0 and very high Q2:

- The energy dependence of the total cross section for real Compton scattering at Q2=0 is described using the Good-Walker formalism for all values of Q2 considered, while the Block and Cahn model overestimates the data for large Q2[^1].
- For very high Q2, the cross sections rise with energy as $W^2Œµ^1$ at Q2=0 and change to $W^2Œµ^0$ for very high Q2, where Œµ^1^ ‚âà 0.09[^2].

 What is the dimension of the SiPM-on-tile technology used in the Few-Degree Calorimeter (FDC)? How many layers of SiPM-on-tile technology are used in the FDC?,"Hello! The SiPM-on-tile technology used in the Few-Degree Calorimeter (FDC) is based on the CALI, which is a high-granularity calorimeter. Here are the details:

- The SiPM-on-tile technology used in the FDC is based on the CALI, which is a high-granularity calorimeter that offers flexibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and high performance for high-granularity calorimeters[^1^].
- The FDC design includes alternating layers of vertical and horizontal scintillators that are wrapped in reflective foil and read out using SiPMs (HPK 14160-1315PS)[^2^].

 What is the sampling fraction for the HCal insert?,"Hello! The sampling fraction for the HCal insert is 0.9%. This fraction is computed by taking the ratio of the output energy to the input energy in the calorimeter. It is important to note that the response for pions in the insert is mostly Gaussian, but it shows a low-energy tail, which is much less pronounced with the first layer of the HCal insert placed at z=380 mm¬π.

 What are the advantages of using certain forms of the spin precession vector in the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)? How are different forms of the spin precession vector related? What is the utility of the form of the spin precession vector?,"Hello! The advantages of using certain forms of the spin precession vector in the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) are as follows:

- Certain forms of the spin precession vector in the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) have been demonstrated to be advantageous, as shown by a detailed re-derivation of the spin matching conditions by V. Ptitsyn for the spin rotators in the ESR[^1^].
- Different forms of the spin precession vector found in the literature are equivalent and related by spin-orbit motion of a particle in an accelerator, including fringe fields.
