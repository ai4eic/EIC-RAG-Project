# Ingestion of data into the RAG system

## Naive RAG based system

When approaching this within naive RAG framework. One can find intelligent ways (without the use of LLM) during this stage

### Choosing the Vector DB

### Types of chunking

### Choosing an Embedding

### Adding meta data to each vector which can later be filtered

### Choosing a Prompt Template

### 

## Advanced RAG based system 


## Modular RAG System

### To generate sample vectorDB after downloading sample arxive file
- `python download_arxiv.py -i test_arxiv_sources.info -o downloaded_files` 

### to run the `ingest.py` file
